# ðŸ“¨ Detecting Spam Messages Using Machine Learning

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement
Spam messages are a major issue in digital communication, often leading to phishing, scams, and unwanted advertisements.  
The goal of this project is to **build a machine learning model that can accurately classify messages as spam or not spam (ham)**.  
This helps in improving user safety, productivity, and maintaining cleaner communication channels.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Analyze text messages to identify distinguishing patterns between spam and ham.
- Preprocess textual data for model training.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for spam detection.
- Deploy or visualize the final model performance.

## ðŸ§  Methodology
1. **Data Collection** â€“ SMS spam dataset or similar public dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Removing punctuation, stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.
3. **Feature Extraction** â€“ Using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
4. **Model Training** â€“ Training models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
6. **Prediction** â€“ Classify new messages as spam or ham.
